	"The team made from dreams." - No One Yet
</body>


<body> 
	This is a team full of people who can dream and make those dreams a reality when they have nothing else to do. They don't quit or give up unless they do. The training they don't do is gives us a special psychological advantage over other teams. This is thanks to our coach Carter Beesly and a our sponsor Blobby Jam. We always try our best to win even when we play.
