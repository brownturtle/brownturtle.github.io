<h3>
	Curry Thunder
</h3>
<body> 
	This is a team full of people who can dream and make those dreams a reality when they have nothing else to do. They don't quit or give up unless they do. The training they don't do is gives us a special psychological advantage over other teams. This is thanks to our coach Carter Beesly and a our sponsor Blobby Jam. We always try our best to win even though its not much.
