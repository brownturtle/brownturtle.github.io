<h3>
	What is Curry Thunder.
</h3>

<body> 
	<p>Curry Thunder is a team me and my friends made for dodge ball and soccer. We are a group of students with a love for sports and we show it by utterly decimating the competition. We had won dodge ball by beating the other sub par teams and we placed third in soccer (out of three teams.). We are currently playing Ultimate Frisbee but after one game the team disbanded due to complicated issues (SPED).
