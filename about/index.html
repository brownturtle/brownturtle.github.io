<body> 
	This is a team full of people who can dream and make those dreams a reality when they have nothing else to do. They don't quit or give up unless they do. The training they don't do is gives us a special psychological advantage over other teams. This is thanks to our coach Carter Beesly and a our sponsor Blobby Jam. We always try our best to win even when we play.

<h3>
	Curry Thunder what is it?
</h3>
<body>
	Some sports teams will tell you that they are for the people but not Curry Thunder. We believe strongly in the concept of survival of the fittest. We also apply this in our games because when we lose or win its not the team its usually one person.
