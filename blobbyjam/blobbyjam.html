	<p>Blobby Jam is one of our sponsors otherwise known as Callum. He can do what ever he wants and sometimes it is beneficial to the team and sometimes he goes to the mall instead of our games at lunch. Although the latter occurs the most his support is really meaningful. Everyone wants to hear him jeer at the opponents and make funny jokes about them and when we lose he is always there to make us feel bad although he wasn't playing. All in all Callum is invaluable in the bleachers or on the floor.
